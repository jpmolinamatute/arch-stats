# PostgreSQL Client Authentication Configuration File
#
# Columns:
#  TYPE  DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS          METHOD  [OPTIONS]
#
# Notes:
# 1. 'peer' over local sockets maps OS user -> DB role (good for dev if names match).
# 2. Use 'scram-sha-256' for password auth.
# 3. The previous file had a malformed host line missing ADDRESS, causing:
#      end-of-line before authentication method (line N)
# 4. Removed the 'superuser' line (role did not exist) to avoid confusion.

# Local socket access for postgres superuser (system user inside container)
local   all       postgres                                peer

# Local socket access for any role (switch to scram-sha-256 if you prefer password auth locally)
local   all       all                                     peer

# IPv4 access: allow all addresses (development). Restrict in production.
host    all       all       0.0.0.0/0                      scram-sha-256
local   all       all                                      scram-sha-256
