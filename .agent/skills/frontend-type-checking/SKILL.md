# Frontend Type Checking

To perform type checking on the frontend codebase:

1. **Navigate to Directory:** Change to the `./frontend/` directory.
2. **Run Command:** Execute `npm run type-check` to perform type checking.
3. **Constraint:** Do not bypass type checking errors; if `npm run type-check` fails, fix
   the underlying code issues before completing the task.
